# 06 — Remaining work (delete-on-done ledger)

Every partially finished (◐/◑) or not-started (☐) item extracted from
05-PARITY-CHECKLIST.md on 2026-07-22 (owner request). **Rows are deleted as they
land** — the burn-down is complete: sections A–E landed together, the final
integration sweep (2026-07-22) closed the last cross-agent seams, and the final
UI wave (2026-07-22) built the Dart-side UI the v0.9 engine surface unblocked
(beat markers, sequence sub-bars, the overrun HOLD hatch, asset read-back,
effect-param animation, `.lumfx` presets, mask geometry, the Auto tier). **What
survives below is only genuinely blocked or honestly-deferred work, each row
carrying the evidence for why it cannot land yet.** 05 stays the permanent
record.

Excluded on purpose (not parity work): flutter_rust_bridge codegen (deferred by
design until the API stabilises), the macOS pass, the post-parity design changes
in 05 §post-parity, and the two recorded behavioural deviations (export
queue-snapshot timing; share-export VBR cap).

Closed in the final sweep (2026-07-22), removed from the burn-down:

- **Shell Ctrl+C/V → keyframe clipboard** — the shell key handler now routes
  Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V to `AppStateStub.copySelectedKeyframes`/`pasteKeyframes`
  (`shell/shell.dart`), behind the same text-field focus gate as the other
  shortcuts (egui note 2.2 / UI-7).
- **Resolution picker downsample** — `PreviewSource` threads
  `app.previewScale.factor` through the primary comp render (and the Dart LRU
  key carries the scale, mirroring the engine cache's per-scale keying), so
  Half/Third/Quarter actually render fewer pixels (`preview_source.dart`).
- **Timeline cache bar** — the `cache_stats` Dart binding was already on
  `CacheControlBridge`; `AppStateStub.cacheStats()` exposes it, warm frames are
  tracked as the `PreviewSource` drives them into the engine cache
  (`noteFrameWarmed`, scoped per comp+scale, reset on edit/clear), and
  `panels/timeline/cache_bar.dart` draws the RAM-tier band over the ruler
  (theme.success, 15-DESIGN §6.3), polling on the `cacheBarRevision` cadence,
  never per-paint.
- **Layer context menu final wiring** — Rename opens an in-place outline editor
  (`renameLayer`), Add effect opens the categorised submenu from `listEffects()`
  (`addEffect`), Convert to sequenced calls `convertToSequenced`, and Trim to
  source end calls `trimToSourceEnd`, offered only for a retimed footage clip
  (the egui condition, menu.rs:174-184) — `panels/timeline/layer_menu.dart`,
  `layer_row.dart`.
- **EffectDragData onto timeline rows** — each layer row is now a
  `DragTarget<EffectDragData>`; a dropped effect applies to that row's layer
  through `addEffect` (`layer_row.dart`), the sibling of the Effect controls
  drop target.
- **Project-panel thumbnails** — footage rows render a small decoded thumbnail
  through `app.thumbnail`, decoded asynchronously off the build and cached until
  the document epoch advances (a relink re-decodes), with the type glyph as the
  placeholder (`project_panel.dart`).
- **DragValueField Reset targets** — sensible `resetTo` defaults now flow to the
  transform axes (the property seed), the text size (72 pt), the New-composition
  width/height/duration (1920×1080 / 30 s), the autosave interval/copies (5 / 3)
  and the three cache budgets (`effect_controls_panel.dart`, `dialogs.dart`,
  `settings_window.dart`).

Closed in the v0.9 engine-surface wave (2026-07-22), removed from the burn-down
— every one was *expose-what-exists* or a clean wire, not an engine-model change
(evidence: the model already held clips, marker kinds, `start_offset`, the text/
solid/camera assets, and the full `EffectKey` + parameter `Property` animations;
lumit-eval's `RealtimeController` was built and tested, only unwired):

- **Recovery journal-append wired** — `Bridge` now carries a `JournalFile` armed
  at every document-install point (`new_project`/`open_project`/
  `restore_journal`), and `state::commit`/`journal_append` append every op after
  a successful store commit (the direct-commit ops — `new_composition`,
  `import_footage`, the retime `→Rate` setter — append too), matching egui's
  `AppState::commit`. Save/new clear it. `restore_journal` now recovers THIS
  frontend's unsaved work.
- **Beat markers drawn distinctly** — the snapshot now carries `marker_details`
  (`[{frame, kind, confidence?, label, duration_frames?}]`) alongside the bare
  `markers` frames (additive). `kind` is the model's `MarkerKind`
  (`user`/`beat`/`chapter`); a beat carries its 0..1 confidence. Dart:
  `BridgeMarker` on `BridgeComp.markerDetails`.
- **Sequence sub-bars** — a Sequence layer's `clips` ride the snapshot (stable
  ids, comp-frame placement, source refs, the clip's retime). Dart: `BridgeClip`
  on `BridgeLayer.clips`.
- **Overrun HOLD hatch — the data** — a layer now carries `start_offset_frame`/
  `start_offset_secs` and its `in_secs`/`out_secs`, the ingredients
  `overrun_span_secs` (`speed_rows.rs:68`) needs that the frame-only read-back
  lacked. (Drawing the hatch itself is Dart-side Timeline work; the missing
  engine data — the blocker — is closed.)
- **Property editors — read-back** — text content/size/fill, a solid's size (the
  colour already crossed) and a camera's zoom now read back from the snapshot
  (`BridgeLayer.text`/`solidSize`/`cameraZoom`), off the session-edit map.
- **Viewer mask draw — geometry** — `add_mask_geometry(comp, layer, kind, x, y,
  w, h)` builds a rectangle/ellipse/star from a drawn drag rect exactly as
  egui's Shape tool does (`overlays.rs`), so the drawn size/position is honoured.
  Dart: `AppStateStub.addMaskGeometry`.
- **Resolution picker — realtime-tier readout** — lumit-eval's
  `RealtimeController` (K-171) is wired into the Viewer render path: a genuine
  render reports its measured cost (`realtime::observe`, gated so a manual-scale
  render never corrupts the Auto model), and `playback_tier`/`reset_realtime`
  expose the tier + scale. Dart: `BridgePlaybackTier`, `AppStateStub.playbackTier`.
- **Effects presets — `.lumfx`** — `save_effect_preset` returns the stack as
  `.lumfx` JSON byte-compatible with `lumit-ui`'s `preset.rs` (a round-trip test
  pins the two), `load_effect_preset` appends with fresh ids (K-065); the
  snapshot also now carries each effect's full `EffectKey` (namespace + version)
  and each animatable parameter's animation state. Dart side needs only the file
  dialogs.
- **Effect controls — per-parameter stopwatch/navigator** — the effect-param
  keyframe ops (`toggle`/`add`/`remove`/`shift`/`set_interp`, with a `channel`
  selector for point/colour) mirror the transform keyframe ops exactly, driving
  each parameter's `Property` animation. Dart:
  `AppStateStub.toggleEffectParamAnimated` and kin.

Closed in the final UI wave (2026-07-22) — the Dart-side UI the v0.9 surface
unblocked, each built against its egui source and covered by
`test/final_ui_wave_test.dart` (plus the existing `edit_ops_test.dart` v0.9
pass-throughs):

- **Timeline beat markers drawn distinctly** — the ruler now takes
  `BridgeComp.markerDetails`; a beat draws as a faint accent tick fading by
  confidence (`0.25 + 0.55·confidence`) from a quarter down the band, a
  user/chapter marker full-height with its flag — mirroring egui `panel.rs:252`.
  Falls back to the bare `markers` frames (all user) on an older library
  (`panels/timeline/ruler.dart`).
- **Sequence sub-bars** — a Sequence layer's clip bar draws its `BridgeClip`
  boundaries as interior hairline dividers (the razor's cut points),
  `panels/timeline/layer_row.dart` `_LaneBarPainter`.
- **Overrun HOLD hatch** — a retimed footage layer that outruns its probed
  source washes + 45° hatches the held span in warning kraft with the exhaustion
  tick and a HOLD tag (panel.rs:994-1076). The `overrun_span_secs`/
  `overrun_local_time`/`evaluate` maths (speed_rows.rs:68, retime.rs:533/1124)
  are ported into `graph_maths.dart` and unit-tested; the span shifts by the
  live move delta like egui's `move_dx`.
- **Asset editors adopt read-back** — the Text/Solid/Camera groups seed from the
  snapshot (`layer.text`/`solidSize`/`cameraZoom`), dropping the session-map
  fallback where read-back exists (`effect_controls_panel.dart`,
  `AppStateStub.textContentFor`/`solidSizeFor`/`cameraZoomFor`).
- **Effect-param animation** — every animatable effect-param row (scalar +
  per-channel for point/colour) carries the stopwatch + ◄◆► navigator, driving
  the v0.9 keyframe ops (`effect_controls_panel.dart` `_FxKeyframeControls`).
- **.lumfx preset UI** — Effects & presets gains Save/Load preset, serialising
  through `save_effect_preset` (byte-compatible with `preset.rs`) to a file the
  user picks and appending a chosen `.lumfx` via `load_effect_preset`; the
  placeholder is gone (`effects_presets_panel.dart`, `file_dialogs.dart` preset
  seams). *Named remainder:* egui also LISTS saved presets above the categories
  (scanning `lumit_project::presets_dir()`); the bridge exposes save/load but no
  listing, so the browser row awaits a `list_presets`/`presets_dir` op.
- **Mask drawing with real geometry** — the Shape-tool drag maps its rect into
  comp pixels and commits `add_mask_geometry`, so the drawn size/position is
  honoured; the default-mask fallback is gone (`viewer_overlays.dart`).
- **Auto resolution tier** — the resolution picker gains Auto (egui's option
  set, overlays.rs:603); under Auto the preview renders at the realtime
  controller's live tier (`effectivePreviewScale`) and the transport reads the
  tier back, polled on the playback cadence (`viewer_panel.dart`,
  `AppStateStub.setPreviewAuto`/`pollPlaybackTier`).
- **Comp-strip popout wording** — the "pop out timeline" entry now explains the
  Timeline stays docked (it owns the transport + preview cache the panel split
  keeps in-window, 06 §E) rather than promising a future popout
  (`panels/timeline/comp_tabs.dart`).

Closed in the LayerMap / fx-lane wave (2026-07-22), removed from the burn-down
(§D and §C):

- **Viewer transform gizmo — full manipulator (§D).** The egui `LayerMap`
  (comp→viewer-pixel mapping with position/anchor/scale/rotation, `timeline/
  mod.rs:30-85`) is ported into `panels/viewer_layer_map.dart` (`ViewerLayerMap`
  + `panBehindPosition`), unit-tested against hand-computed cases
  (`test/viewer_layer_map_test.dart`). The gizmo (`panels/viewer_overlays.dart`)
  now draws the layer's bounding box through the map, corner/edge scale handles
  (a drag commits `scale_x`/`scale_y` on release, animation-aware), the anchor
  crosshair as the exact egui `anchor_overlay` pan-behind (drag → `anchor_x/y` +
  `position_x/y`, keying keyed props / setting static ones — egui's `mk`
  closure), and a body drag committing Position; handles hit-test in viewer
  space with the K-116 slop, live-preview while dragging, commit on release. It
  draws over both the shared-texture and CPU paths (positioned from the fitted
  rect `viewer_panel.dart` passes in). *egui-gap verdict (verified in
  `overlays.rs`, read end to end):* egui's viewer overlays draw **only** the
  anchor-cross pan-behind drag (`anchor_overlay`, lines 143-242) — there is **no
  bounding box, no scale handles and no rotation affordance** in egui. The box,
  scale handles and body drag are the Flutter "full manipulator" the LayerMap
  unblocks, built on the exact ported maths and the same animation-aware
  transform ops. **Rotation is not built** (egui offers none). `test/
  viewer_gizmo_test.dart` covers the box/handle render and each drag's committed
  op (body/anchor pan-behind/corner-both/edge-one/keyed→keyframe).
- **Effect-param keyframe lanes in the Timeline outline (§C).** The outline twirl
  now grows an "Effects" group per layer (shown only when the layer has effects,
  collapsed by default) with a sub-twirl per effect and one lane row per
  animatable parameter — stopwatch, ◄ ◆ ► navigator, value readout, and the
  param's keyframes drawn on the lane (`FxParamRow` in `panels/timeline/
  property_row.dart`, wired in `timeline_panel.dart` `_layerBlock`). The fx
  keyframe logic (channels, union frames, channel fields) is shared with the
  Effect controls panel through `panels/timeline/fx_keys.dart` (the panel's
  `_channels`/`_frames`/`_rgbaOf` now delegate — extracted, not duplicated). The
  lane machinery generalised: `LaneKeyId` carries an optional `(effectId,
  channel)` (transform keys leave it null), so fx keys select / drag / copy-paste
  through the same `TimelineLaneHost` — `keyDragEnd` splits transform vs fx and
  commits `shiftEffectParamKeyframes` (per channel), `keyRemove` routes to
  `removeEffectParamKeyframe`, and the clipboard carries fx keys (pasted via
  per-key `addEffectParamKeyframe` + interp restore, since the bridge has no
  effect batch op). *egui verdict (per-channel vs one row, verified in
  `effect_rows.rs`):* egui draws **one lane row per param** (Float; an X/Y pair
  folded to one row keyed on x), **never per-channel**, and colour params get no
  lane — mirrored here as one union lane per animatable param. *Named remainder:*
  the fx lane has no right-click interpolation menu (the transform interp menu is
  `applyKeyframeBatch`-shaped; an fx-interp menu is a small follow-up — the
  `setEffectParamKeyframeInterp` op exists).

## Blocked — awaiting engine/bridge capability, with evidence

Each row states the specific missing capability. None can land Dart-side without
it; landing a half-built version would drift the engine's behaviour, so they are
annotated honestly rather than faked.

**Section A — bridge caveats (landed with a named follow-up):**

- **Beat detection runs synchronously** in the bridge (`detect_beats` mixes the
  comp audio through the headless input builder and analyses in one blocking
  call the Dart side awaits off its UI isolate), where egui runs it off-thread
  (`detect_beats`/`poll_beats`). If long-audio latency bites, a start/poll pair
  like the export ops is the follow-up — the maths is identical, only the
  threading differs. **Not converted in the v0.9 wave** (it functions today; the
  conversion is a threading refactor, not a missing capability).

**Section B — performance follow-ups:**

- **Fence/keyed-mutex handshake for the shared texture** — only if the owner's
  live run shows tearing. **Verify on the owner's machine first**; not built
  speculatively. The shared texture presents without a producer/consumer fence
  today.
- **Footage probing off-thread** — the thumbnail half of this landed; the
  off-thread probe move did not. The bridge's synchronous probe cache is read
  *synchronously* by several ops — `convert_to_sequenced` and
  `trim_to_source_end` (source duration, `items.rs`), `add_footage_layer`
  sizing, and relink's sibling-missing check — so moving probing onto a worker
  needs those consumers to probe-on-demand or the ops silently degrade to their
  unprobed fallback. Named follow-up: a probe worker drained on
  `lumit_bridge_snapshot` polls (mirroring egui's `MediaRegistry::poll`) **plus**
  a synchronous `ensure_probed` fallback for the consumers above. **Not done in
  the v0.9 wave** (functions synchronously today; the worker + fallbacks are a
  threading refactor, not a missing capability).

**Section C — timeline and graph:**

- **Graph editor — the transform value graph and the Retime Time (source-position)
  lens** — **BUILT** (2026-07-22, `graph.rs:86-94`/`anim.rs`, K-078). The graph
  editor now offers all three lenses `graph.rs` does, picked in a shared header:
  the transform **value graph** for the selected/first-animated property (the
  piecewise per-key-pair curve — Hold steps, Linear lines, Bezier segments sampled
  densely from the real `anim::CubicSpan` bezier, never polylines between keys),
  with interp-coded glyphs (`key_glyph.dart`), a selected-key ring, in-time+value
  key drag, draggable gold tangent handles (the `speed`/`influence` ↔ endpoint
  geometry ported from `graph.rs`), the graph-key right-click interp menu (Easy
  ease / Linear / Hold / Delete) and double-click-to-add; the **Retime Time lens**
  (source position over comp time via `Retime::evaluate`, boundary joins dragged
  in TIME through the `dragBoundary` op — its faithful home, docs/04 §9.1); and
  the existing **Retime speed lens**. The **lens picker**, the **Vegas
  default-lens preference** (`graph.rs:164` — an in-memory `AppState` field, not a
  Setting; mirrored as `AppStateStub.vegasDefaultLens`, session scope) and
  **boundary beat/frame snapping** (`graph.rs:1616-1628`) all landed. Pure maths
  in `graph_maths.dart` (bezier sampling, handle mapping, source-position
  sampling, axis ticks, snapping), unit-tested against hand-computed values and
  the `anim.rs` EASY_EASE midpoint; widgets in `graph_value_lens.dart`,
  `graph_time_lens.dart`, `graph_speed_lens.dart`, dispatched by `graph_editor.dart`.
  *Named residuals (bridge-op fidelity):* the Flutter bridge exposes only granular
  keyframe ops (no whole-`Animation` setter), so a key drag that moves BOTH time
  and value commits `shiftKeyframes` then `addKeyframe` (≤ 2 undo steps; a
  value-only drag is one) rather than egui's single `SetTransformProperty`; and the
  Time lens's *vertical* (source-position) boundary drag has no bridge op
  (`SetLayerRetime`/`from_source_keyframes` unexposed), so only the horizontal
  (time) boundary drag is committable — an honest scope edge, same spirit as the
  speed lens. Marquee multi-select of value keys is likewise deferred (single-key
  selection landed).
  *egui-gap verdicts (04-RETIMING spec-only — egui never built them, verified in
  graph.rs and excluded from parity):* RATE/MAP **type chips** + ease-name labels
  (§9.4); **kink badges** (§6.1); **numeric % and t·s entry fields** (§9.3); the
  graph's **own overrun hatching** (§7.2 — egui hatches overrun only on the clip
  bar, `panel.rs:992`, which the clip-bar HOLD hatch now draws).

**Section E — chrome and shell:**

- **Pop out a panel into its own OS window (multi-window)** — BUILT behind
  seams, pending on-machine verification (2026-07-22, re-attempt). The earlier
  block rested on two findings; the **second was wrong**, so the row reopened.
  - *SDK finding (stands).* The pinned stable SDK ships multi-window only as
    `_window.dart` — every symbol `@internal` (importing it fails `flutter
    analyze`), each API throwing unless `isWindowingEnabled` (a build-time flag
    OFF by default). Its own API is therefore still not used. Not fought.
  - *Community finding (corrected).* The old note said each window runs in its
    own engine/isolate with a **separate Dart heap** and concluded a popout
    could not reach the document. The heap fact is true; the conclusion is not.
    `desktop_multi_window` (0.3.0, Apache-2.0, MixinNetwork; no third-party deps,
    SDK `>=3.5.0` — compatible with `^3.12.2`) runs each secondary window as a
    second Flutter engine in the **same OS process** (engine-per-window;
    verified against the package's `window_controller.dart` + pub metadata, and
    the same in-process model `multi_window_native` uses). A popout does not
    need the main window's Dart objects — it needs the DOCUMENT, and that is
    process-wide: the popout opens its OWN `LumitBridge.tryLoad()` handle to the
    one already-loaded `lumit_bridge.dll`, reaching the same
    `static BRIDGE: OnceLock<Mutex<Bridge>>` (the exact fact `bridge.dart`
    already records for the render isolate: "same process, so the same engine
    state behind the bridge's process-wide `Mutex`").
  - *Built.* `lib/popout/`: `popout_arguments.dart` (panel + theme snapshot
    serialised across the window boundary, panel-split gate), `popout_app_state.dart`
    (`PopoutAppState extends AppStateStub` adding a public `resync` from the
    shared surface only — the file it extends is another agent's, untouched),
    `popout_host.dart` (theme from the snapshot, the panel body over the popout
    state, ~2 Hz snapshot poll, clean disposal), `popout_windows.dart` (the
    fake-injectable opener seam), `desktop_window_opener.dart` (the one file that
    touches the plugin; close detected by diffing `WindowController.getAll()` on
    `onWindowsChanged`), `popout_main.dart` (the sub-window entrypoint). Wired at
    `shell/shell.dart onPopOut` (float on open, re-dock on close) +
    `dock_widget.dart` (offer gated to hostable panels), `main.dart` (popout
    dispatch), and `windows/runner/flutter_window.cpp` (sub-window plugin
    callback).
  - *Panel split.* Offered for the read-mostly panels a second engine hosts
    honestly — Project, Hierarchy, Effect controls, Effects & presets, Scopes
    (Scopes renders pixels via the CPU render path, which works from any engine).
    The **Viewer and Timeline stay in-window**: the Viewer owns the shared-texture
    registrar (a per-view concern) and the Timeline owns the playhead/transport
    and the cache-bar warm set tied to the main preview — a second engine would
    fork that state.
  - *Staleness model (caveat).* The popout sees a main-window edit via its own
    ~2 Hz `resync` poll; its own edits reach the shared journal and self-refresh.
    The **main window** sees a popout's edit only on its next interaction —
    `AppStateStub` has no public resync and this agent does not own that file, so
    no main-window polling was added (documented, not faked).
  - *Verification (caveat).* The native plugin, the `main.dart` dispatch and the
    runner callback compile only in a real `flutter build windows` on the owner's
    machine. The `flutter analyze` / `flutter test` / `flutter pub get` gates
    could not be run in the implementing environment (no Dart/Flutter toolchain);
    tests are behind seams (a fake opener, a fake bridge) and never open a real
    window (`test/popout_test.dart`). Window sizing/title is a `window_manager`
    follow-up. Close the row once the gates run green on the owner's machine.

## Deferred, not blocked

- **Audio playback follow-ups (recorded with the round-5 build, 2026-07-22).**
  Comp audio playback itself LANDED (bridge v0.10 — the tester's "no audio at
  all" is closed; see 05's F2 audio row). Four named remainders, none blocking:
  *output-latency compensation* (docs/impl/playback-scheduler.md §4 allows the
  omission at the ±half-frame tolerance; egui omits it identically today), the
  *Cached-mode render-gated audio pause* (K-171 — the Flutter picture free-runs
  rather than render-gating, so sound can lead an uncached stretch where egui
  parks it; needs the Dart side to know frame readiness, i.e. a cache-bar-fed
  gate), *footage-item preview audio* (the Flutter Viewer previews comps; the
  egui footage-item transport plays the item's own sound), and the *per-layer
  Waveform lanes* (K-172 — needs the item peaks surfaced over the bridge).

- **Tooltip breadth pass — the remaining `on_hover_text` surfaces.** The shell +
  widgets tooltips landed; the remaining egui hover surfaces (layer switches,
  transport step/loop, the ruler, the scopes header) are optional cosmetic
  polish, not parity-blocking, and are unbuilt only by choice — deliberately none
  on menu-bar items, the splash, command-palette rows and dock tab pills (egui
  parity).

## Reconciled in 05

- (2026-07-22, section-A burn-down): the graph-lens "→Rate drift figure dropped
  by BridgeReply" remainder was stale — `driftSeconds` is threaded and the notice
  reads "fitted, N ms drift"; 05's F3 graph-lens named-remainder dropped the
  drift-figure caveat.

## Platform passes and engine enhancements (recorded 2026-07-22, from the
## owner's friend's review — outside this branch's parity scope, never lost)

- **Shared-texture on Linux — BUILT, pending the collaborator's runtime
  verification (2026-07-22, K-177).** The zero-copy Viewer path now has its Linux
  equivalent: Vulkan → DMA-BUF fd → the GTK embedder's GL external texture, the
  mirror of the Windows DXGI path. Engine: `crates/lumit-gpu/src/shared_linux.rs`
  (exportable `VkImage`, linear tiling, `vkGetMemoryFdKHR` via ash; the device is
  opened with the external-memory extensions appended since wgpu 24 does not
  enable them by default), `render_to_shared_dmabuf` through the headless seam and
  the bridge (`lumit_bridge_render_to_shared_dmabuf`, a separate export so the
  Windows ABI is untouched; `shared_supported` now Windows-or-Linux). Runner:
  `linux/runner/viewer_texture_bridge.{h,cc}` — an `FlTextureGL` subclass importing
  the DMA-BUF via `EGLImage`/`EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import`, the same
  `lumit/viewer_texture` channel protocol as Windows but with `{fd, width, height,
  stride, offset, fourcc, modifier}` on `register`. Dart branches
  `ViewerTextureController.ensureRegistered` by platform. DRM story shipped: RGBA8,
  **linear tiling**, `DRM_FORMAT_ABGR8888`, `DRM_FORMAT_MOD_LINEAR` (the simpler
  route the `flutter_wgpu_texture` reference offered alongside its full
  format-modifier path).
  - **What CI proves:** the Rust half compiles (`cargo check -p lumit-bridge
    --features shared-texture-linux` in the `flutter-linux` job), the GTK plugin
    compiles and links (`flutter build linux`, EGL+GLESv2 on the line), `flutter
    analyze` + the full `flutter test` (the DMA-BUF register branch is fake-channel
    tested), and the three Windows-runnable Rust configs stay byte-identical (the
    Linux code is behind `cfg(target_os = "linux")` + the feature).
  - **What awaits the collaborator:** the picture actually appearing on a real
    Linux GPU — the GPU/CPU indicator reading GPU, correct colours, kill-switch
    behaviour, and reporting a blank/wrong Viewer. Recipe in GUIDE §9. The authoring
    box is Windows and cannot build or run any of the Linux native code.
- **Shared-texture on macOS.** Still Windows+Linux only; the macOS texture path
  needs an IOSurface/Metal implementation (named in 03-ARCHITECTURE) when the macOS
  Flutter pass happens. The CPU path is the portable fallback by design.
- **GPU-side scope pass — BUILT (2026-07-22, K-096 v1).** The Scopes are now
  computed on the GPU: a new WGSL pass in lumit-gpu (`crates/lumit-gpu/src/
  scope.rs` + `scope.wgsl`) bins the displayed frame into per-scope counters
  (three compute passes — `bin` via `atomic<u32>` storage buffers, `peak_reduce`,
  and `colourise` into an `rgba8unorm` storage texture), all core WGSL so the CI
  lavapipe oracles run it unchanged. GPU oracle tests assert the bin counts
  against the CPU maths exactly (atomics never round) and the trace pixels within
  the ±1 the fp `sqrt` allows across adapters. Bridge: `lumit_bridge_render_scope`
  (render.rs `render_scope`) rides the existing rendered-frame cache — a frame
  already banked for the Viewer serves the scope without re-rendering the comp,
  and the scope traces the exact bytes the Viewer shows (preview == the traced
  frame). Dart: `ScopeTraceBridge` on the `LumitBridge`, and `scopes_panel.dart`
  prefers the engine trace with the CPU `buildTraceRgba` as the old-dll / no-adapter
  fallback (the throttle is gone — every displayed frame traces). *Delivery
  decision (texture vs tiny buffer, recorded honestly):* the trace ships as a tiny
  256×256 RGBA readback (~256 KiB), **not** a second shared texture. The win is
  moving the binning off the CPU; the trace is so small a zero-copy hand-off would
  save nothing while costing a second registered texture (VRAM the frame cache
  does not model — framecache.rs already documents the shared path holds exactly
  one texture) and a second Dart texture id + C++ registrar path that compiles
  only on the owner's machine. The tiny buffer is also portable — it degrades on
  Linux via the same CPU fallback as the Viewer, where a second shared texture
  would be Windows/D3D12-only. It is an ENGINE enhancement benefiting both
  frontends, so it belongs on main.
- **Thumbnails stay CPU-decoded on purpose**: the egui frontend also decodes
  thumbnails on the CPU; they are tiny one-off images, not per-frame streams —
  parity holds and zero-copy would buy nothing.

## Scheduled work (owner priorities, 2026-07-22 round 3)

1. **Linux build of the Flutter frontend** — DONE pending CI (2026-07-22).
   *Unverified until the branch's next CI run:* this Windows box cannot build
   Flutter-for-Linux, so the `flutter build linux` half is proven only by the
   new CI job, not locally. What landed:
   - **linux/ runner scaffolded** (`flutter create --platforms linux`),
     `.metadata` restored to list *both* windows and linux (flutter create had
     replaced the windows entry). The generated `my_application.cc` gains the
     `desktop_multi_window` sub-window plugin-registration callback (mirroring
     `windows/runner/flutter_window.cpp`). *(Update, K-177: the viewer-texture
     bridge is now ported to Linux via DMA-BUF —
     `linux/runner/viewer_texture_bridge.{h,cc}`, registered on the main engine in
     `my_application.cc`. The CPU path remains the fallback when the
     `shared-texture-linux` feature is off or the GPU cannot support it.)*
   - **Platform-portable bridge loader** (`lib/bridge/bridge.dart`
     `_candidatePaths`): the base name branches on `Platform` —
     `lumit_bridge.dll` on Windows (byte-identical to before),
     `liblumit_bridge.so` elsewhere — with the identical search order. The
     render isolate and popout inherit it through `candidateLibraryPaths()`.
     Covered by a new group in `test/bridge_test.dart` that runs green on both
     the Windows host and the Linux CI.
   - **Windows-only surfaces degrade cleanly.** The shared texture falls back to
     the CPU path when its feature is off (the D3D interop is
     `cfg(all(windows, feature = "shared-texture"))` and off by default, so default
     features carry nothing Windows-only). *(Update, K-177: Linux now has its own
     zero-copy path behind `shared-texture-linux`; with that feature off — the
     default — the CPU fallback is unchanged.)* The settings RAM probe gains a
     Linux `/proc/meminfo` branch. **Pop-out is NOT gated off Linux** —
     `desktop_multi_window` 0.3.0 has a first-class Linux (GTK) implementation.
   - **CI:** a `flutter-linux` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (existing jobs
     untouched) copies the `linux` job's apt + FFmpeg + libclang steps, adds the
     GTK/clang/cmake/ninja Flutter toolchain, pins Flutter 3.44.7, and runs
     `flutter pub get` / `analyze` / `test`, `cargo build -p lumit-bridge`, and
     `flutter build linux --release`. *(Update, K-177: it also installs
     `libgles-dev` and runs `cargo check -p lumit-bridge --features
     shared-texture-linux`, compiling the Linux DMA-BUF Rust and GTK plugin.)*
   - **Local gates (green here):** `flutter analyze` clean, full `flutter test`
     (411 tests) green on Windows, `cargo check -p lumit-bridge` clean.
2. **GPU scope pass** — DONE (2026-07-22, K-096 v1). A WGSL scope pass in
   lumit-gpu (`scope.rs` + `scope.wgsl`) renders the waveform/RGB-waveform/
   vectorscope/histogram traces engine-side (three compute passes — atomic
   binning, peak reduction, colourise — all core WGSL, lavapipe-clean); the
   bridge's `lumit_bridge_render_scope` rides the rendered-frame cache so the
   scope traces the exact frame the Viewer shows without re-rendering the comp;
   `scopes_panel.dart` prefers the engine trace (`ScopeTraceBridge`) and keeps the
   CPU `buildTraceRgba` as the old-dll / no-adapter fallback, and the throttle is
   gone (every displayed frame traces). **Delivery was a tiny 256×256 RGBA
   readback (~256 KiB), not a second shared texture** — the win is moving the
   binning off the CPU, the trace is too small for a zero-copy hand-off to matter,
   and the tiny buffer degrades on Linux via the same CPU fallback as the Viewer
   (a second shared texture would be Windows-only and cost VRAM the frame cache
   does not model). See the full record in *Platform passes and engine
   enhancements* above. Closes the round-3 "scopes super laggy" report and the
   K-096 v1 note. Gates green on this machine: lumit-gpu + lumit-bridge fmt /
   clippy (`-D warnings` on default, `--no-default-features`, `--features
   shared-texture`) / tests (incl. the GPU oracles on the real adapter);
   `lumit-ui` tests untouched-green; `flutter analyze` clean and the scope panel
   tests green. *Compiles only on the owner's machine:* nothing new — the pass and
   its FFI are portable; only the pre-existing `shared-texture`/D3D interop stays
   Windows-gated, and the scope path does not use it.
3. **Viewer comp-preview placeholder defect** (round 3, top open defect):
   diagnose live why the built app showed the stale placeholder; make the
   placeholder name its reason (library too old / no adapter / render error)
   instead of promising future work.

## Live defect under investigation (round 3, 2026-07-22)

- **The shared-texture Viewer presents an empty texture on the owner's
  machine.** Evidence: a new comp composites over an OPAQUE BLACK background
  (`Composition::background` defaults to `[0,0,0,1]`, model.rs:1515, and
  `render_comp_linear` seeds the composite with it, export.rs:1447/1742), so an
  empty comp must draw a visible black frame; the owner sees only the grey
  pasteboard AND no placeholder text, which means an image/texture IS being
  presented — i.e. the texture registers and draws nothing. The scopes are
  smooth because they ride the CPU read-back, not the texture. This is exactly
  the K-177 caveat that the ANGLE/embedder side of opening the DXGI shared
  handle could only be exercised in the real app; the failure mode not covered
  was "registration succeeds but the surface never shows content" (the
  fallback only triggers on a FAILED registration).
  - Shipped now: a **Settings → Performance → GPU shared texture** kill-switch
    (persisted, takes effect next frame) and a **GPU/CPU indicator** in the
    transport row, so the active path is visible and escapable without a
    rebuild.
  - Next, once the owner confirms the CPU build renders: the handshake itself
    (a keyed mutex or shared fence around the D3D12 copy — the named K-177
    follow-up — and/or the descriptor/`MarkTextureFrameAvailable` ordering in
    `viewer_texture_bridge.cpp`).

## Desk-test round 4 (owner, 2026-07-22)

- **The blank shared-texture Viewer is RESOLVED by observation**: after the
  round-3 rebuild the picture shows on Windows with the GPU switch on and off.
  The root cause was never pinned (the fence/keyed-mutex handshake remains
  unbuilt), so the kill-switch and the GPU/CPU indicator STAY, and if a blank
  frame, stutter or tearing ever recurs the handshake is the first fix.
- **Pop-out round 1 findings (owner: "a later issue", logged not fixed):**
  1. *The popped-out panel's tab stays visible in the main window* — the
     hide-while-floating behaviour (the egui `Shell::floating` contract the
     pop-out was built to honour) is not taking effect; the dock still shows
     the panel. Defect, later.
  2. *Dragging footage from a popped-out Project into the main window does
     nothing* — architectural: `Draggable`/`DragTarget` cannot cross Flutter
     engines (each window is its own engine). A cross-window drop needs a
     bridge-mediated hand-off (or OS-level drag). Caveat recorded; the
     in-window drag and double-click placement still work.
- **The Linux build WORKS** (verified live — the CI-pending caveat is
  retired). The Viewer runs on the CPU path there; the owner now wants the
  **Linux zero-copy texture path (DMA-BUF)** — promoted from the platform-pass
  list to scheduled work.
