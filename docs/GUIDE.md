# The plain-English guide to Kiriko's code

**Who this is for:** the project owner — someone who knows editing software inside-out but
has never written Rust and hasn't worked with threads or GPUs directly. Read this once and
you'll be able to navigate the codebase, understand what each part does and why, and make
changes without fear. Everything here is explained with editing analogies where they help.
No prior programming knowledge in Rust is assumed; general "I've seen code before" level is.

This guide is **kept current by rule** (CLAUDE.md): whenever a new concept enters the
codebase, a plain-English section for it is added here in the same commit.

---

## 1. The 30-second map

Kiriko is split into **crates** (Rust's word for a module/library — think of them as the
app's departments). They live in `crates/`:

| Crate | Job | Plain English |
|---|---|---|
| `kiriko-core` | Time, the document, undo | The project file's brain: what a comp/layer *is*, and every edit that can happen to it |
| `kiriko-project` | `.kir` files, autosave, recovery | Saving and loading, and the "never lose work" machinery |
| `kiriko-ui` | Everything you see | Panels, menus, the theme — the shell around the engine |
| `kiriko-app` | The `main()` entry | Ten lines that open the window and start the UI |
| `kiriko-media` | (coming) decoding video | Turning an .mp4 into frames |
| `kiriko-gpu` | (coming) the GPU pipeline | Drawing and processing frames on the graphics card |
| `kiriko-audio` | (coming) sound | Playback and the clock everything syncs to |
| `kiriko-eval` | (coming) the render engine | Working out what each frame looks like |
| `kiriko-cache` | (coming) caching | Remembering rendered frames so they're never rendered twice |

Three of these have proper names you'll see in the app and docs (decision K-067),
drawn from the Edo-kiriko craft the project is named for: **Togi** (polishing) is the
render pipeline — `kiriko-eval` + `kiriko-gpu` working together to turn the project's
cuts into the picture; **Kura** (storehouse) is the cache; **Hibiki** (resonance) is the
audio engine whose clock everything syncs to. Crate names stay plain `kiriko-*` — the
names are for people, the identifiers are for code.

**One rule ties them together:** the engine crates never depend on the UI. The UI asks the
engine for things; the engine doesn't know the UI exists. That's why the UI could be
replaced entirely without touching the engine — like swapping a car's dashboard without
opening the engine bay.

## 2. Rust in ten minutes, Kiriko edition

You don't need to write Rust to read it. The handful of ideas that appear everywhere:

- **Ownership.** Every piece of data in Rust has exactly one owner, and the compiler
  enforces it. When you see code "cloning" a document, that's making an independent copy so
  two parts of the app can't fight over one. This is the language feature that makes the
  "never crashes" goal realistic — whole categories of crash (two threads corrupting the
  same memory) simply don't compile.
- **`Result` — errors are values, not explosions.** A function that can fail returns
  `Result<Thing, Error>`: either `Ok(thing)` or `Err(why)`. The caller *must* deal with
  both. You'll see `?` a lot — it means "if this failed, pass the error up to my caller".
  Kiriko bans the shortcuts (`unwrap`/`panic`) that turn errors into crashes; the build
  literally fails if someone uses them in engine code.
- **`Option`** is the same idea for "might not exist": `Some(comp)` or `None`. No
  null-pointer crashes, ever.
- **Structs and enums.** A `struct` is a record (a Layer has a name, an in point, an out
  point…). An `enum` is a choice between shapes — `LayerKind` is Footage *or* Sequence *or*
  Text… and the compiler forces every `match` to handle every case, so adding a new layer
  kind makes the compiler point at every place that needs updating. That's why the strict
  glossary maps so well to code.
- **Traits** are capability contracts, like "anything that can decode frames". Code can say
  "give me anything that satisfies this trait" — that's how the engine will stay swappable
  (a CPU decoder and a GPU decoder behind the same trait).
- **`Arc<T>`** means "shared, read-only handle to T" (Atomically Reference Counted). Several
  parts of the app can hold the same document snapshot at once; it's freed automatically
  when the last holder lets go.
- **Crates and Cargo.** `Cargo.toml` files list dependencies (like a plugins list).
  `cargo build` compiles, `cargo run` launches, `cargo test` runs every test. Those three
  commands are 95% of what you'll ever type.

## 3. Threads, in editing terms

A thread is an independent worker inside the program. Kiriko's design gives each worker a
fixed job (the full table is in [05-ARCHITECTURE.md](05-ARCHITECTURE.md)):

- **The UI thread** is front-of-house: it draws the interface and responds to your mouse.
  The golden rule — it **never** does heavy work. Every stutter you've ever felt in AE is
  some engineer breaking this rule. In Kiriko it's structural: the UI thread hands work to
  others and carries on drawing.
- **Worker threads** are the render farm: they evaluate frames, run effects, do maths.
  There are roughly as many as your CPU has cores.
- **Dedicated threads** exist for decoding video, disk IO, and audio — because those jobs
  must never wait behind anything else (audio especially: if its thread is ever late, you
  *hear* it).

Two mechanisms make this safe, and you'll see them by name in the code:

- **Snapshots (`ArcSwap`).** When you edit, the UI thread produces a complete new immutable
  copy of the document and atomically swaps a pointer to it. Workers that were mid-render
  keep the old copy; new work uses the new one. Nobody ever sees a half-finished edit —
  like workers each getting their own printed copy of the script, and edits producing a
  fresh printing rather than scribbling on someone's pages.
- **Epochs (cancellation).** Every piece of work carries a ticket number. When you scrub,
  the global ticket number increments; workers check their ticket often ("is my work still
  wanted?") and quietly stop if it's stale. Nothing is force-killed — force-killing is how
  you corrupt state — everything checks and steps aside. Details in
  [impl/playback-scheduler.md](impl/playback-scheduler.md).
- **Channels** are how threads hand each other work: a conveyor belt with a fixed length.
  A full belt makes the sender wait — that's **back-pressure**, and it's deliberate: it's
  the mechanism that stops the app drowning itself under load (rule K-018, degrade never
  crash).

## 4. What exists today, file by file

- `crates/kiriko-core/src/time.rs` — **Rational time.** Times are stored as exact fractions
  (`num/den`), never decimals, so frame maths is exact forever (a 3-hour NTSC timeline
  never drifts by a frame). The four "timebases" (source/clip/layer/comp time — glossary §4)
  are separate types, so mixing them up is a compile error, not a subtle bug.
- `crates/kiriko-core/src/model.rs` — **What a project is.** Structs for the document,
  comps, layers, footage items. Each has an `extra` field that preserves anything a future
  Kiriko version adds — so old and new versions can share project files.
- `crates/kiriko-core/src/ops.rs` — **Every possible edit, as data.** An edit is an `Op`
  (AddLayer, SetLayerSpan…). Applying an op returns its exact inverse — that pair is what
  makes undo *provably* correct instead of hopefully correct.
- `crates/kiriko-core/src/anim.rs` — **the keyframe engine.** Between two keyframes the
  value follows a bezier curve shaped by AE-style *speed* (units per second) and
  *influence* (how far each handle reaches). The subtle part: the curve is parametric, so
  "value at time t" first requires solving "where on the curve is x = t?" — done with a
  solver that combines Newton's speed with a bracket it mathematically cannot escape.
  That solver quality is exactly what makes handles feel right in a graph editor at the
  extremes (AE's 100% influence "spike" case is a test here). Property tests fire
  thousands of random curves at it per CI run.
- `crates/kiriko-core/src/store.rs` — **The document store**: applies ops, publishes
  snapshots, keeps the undo/redo stacks.
- `crates/kiriko-project/src/lib.rs` — **`.kir` files.** A `.kir` is a zip containing
  readable JSON (rename one to `.zip` and look inside — genuinely). Saves are atomic:
  written to a temp file, flushed to disk, then renamed over the old file, so a crash
  mid-save can never destroy the previous save. The **journal** logs every edit to a side
  file the instant it happens; after a crash, replaying it restores your work.
- `crates/kiriko-media/` — **reading media files** (via FFmpeg, the industry-standard
  media library). Two jobs so far: the *probe* (a file's vital statistics — resolution,
  frame rate, duration — shown under each item in the Project panel) and the *frame
  index* — a scan of the whole file that records where every frame and keyframe sits, so
  scrubbing can land on exactly the right frame. Indexing runs on a background thread
  (the UI never waits) and the result is cached on disk, keyed by a *fingerprint* of the
  file's content — change the file and the stale index is ignored automatically.
- `crates/kiriko-gpu/` — **the colour foundation.** All engine maths happens on
  "light-linear" values (where adding two lights behaves like real light); files and
  screens use sRGB encoding. This crate owns the only two crossings between those worlds
  — decode-side linearise and display-side encode — and a "golden" test proves every
  possible 8-bit value survives the round trip within one step. That test is what makes
  the washed-out/too-dark "double gamma" class of bug impossible to reintroduce, and it's
  the bedrock of the preview-equals-export promise (K-031). The clever part: the shader
  contains no gamma maths at all — the GPU's texture formats do the conversions in
  hardware, so decode and encode can never drift apart.
- `crates/kiriko-gpu/src/composite.rs` — **the compositor seed.** Each layer is a picture
  on glass; the compositor stacks the glass on the GPU. Position/scale/rotation move each
  sheet (already as full 4×4 matrices, so 3D later needs no rewrite), opacity fades it,
  and stacking happens in linear light where combining images behaves like combining real
  light — a test proves the result differs from the naive approach by exactly the amount
  physics predicts. This is the beginning of the evaluator: the thing that will one day
  render whole comps with effects.
- `crates/kiriko-gpu/src/oklab.rs` — **perceptual colour.** Two colour worlds, two jobs:
  linear RGB is where *light* combines correctly (layering, glow, exposure), and Oklab is
  where *perception* behaves — a gradient interpolated in Oklab stays vivid where an RGB
  gradient sags into grey, and rotating a hue in Oklab keeps its brightness. Kiriko
  converts on the fly (a handful of multiplications per pixel), users never see anything
  but normal RGB values, and tests pin both promises: round-trips are exact and hue
  rotation provably never changes lightness.
- `crates/kiriko-cache/` — **the cupboard with a size limit.** Rendered and decoded
  frames get remembered so they're never computed twice; when the cupboard is full,
  whatever was used longest ago gets thrown out first. The limit is in bytes, not item
  counts — one 4K frame costs what sixty thumbnails cost, and budgeting any other way is
  how apps balloon. This is the seed of the three-tier cache the whole engine design
  revolves around.
- `crates/kiriko-ui/src/export.rs` — **writing video files.** Every frame of a comp is
  rendered through the *exact same* colour engine and compositor the Viewer uses, then
  compressed to an .mp4. Using one shared path isn't laziness — it's the design's central
  promise (what you preview IS what you export), and it runs on its own worker so the app
  stays responsive while exporting, with live progress and a real cancel.
- `crates/kiriko-audio/` — **playback and the clock.** The sound card asks for samples on
  its own strict schedule through a "realtime callback" — a tiny function that must never
  wait for anything (if it's ever late, you hear a glitch). The count of samples it has
  played *is* the playback clock: video asks "what time is it?" every frame and shows
  whatever frame matches. One clock, owned by the audio hardware — that's why picture and
  sound can't drift apart, and it's the same design the full engine keeps forever.
- The **graph editor** (tabbed with the Timeline) — click a layer, and its animated
  properties draw as live curves: drag the square keyframes (value and time together, one
  undo per drag), double-click the background to add a key, right-click to remove one.
  The curve you see is sampled from the same evaluator that renders the comp, so what the
  graph shows is exactly what plays.
- The **2.5D camera** — the parallax tool. Every layer has a z position and x/y
  rotations alongside the flat transform; they sleep until you switch the layer to 3D
  (the "3D" toggle in its twirl-down) *and* the comp has a Camera layer
  (Composition → Add camera layer). The camera follows the After Effects model: its
  *zoom* is a focal distance in comp pixels, and a layer sitting at z = 0 draws
  pixel-for-pixel exactly as it did flat — so turning the system on changes nothing
  until you actually move something in depth. Push a layer back (positive z) and it
  shrinks by zoom ÷ (z + zoom); move the camera and near layers slide faster than far
  ones — that's parallax, the flow style's second-most-used trick after speed ramps.
  The topmost visible Camera layer wins when there are several (AE's rule), everything
  on it keyframes like any other property, and the maths lives in one place
  (`camera_matrix` in the GPU crate) shared by preview and export, so a camera move
  can't look different in the exported file. A regression test proves both promises:
  z = 0 maps 1:1, and depth scales exactly as the formula says.
- The **Project panel** — AE-shaped (K-068): the selected item's details up top, the
  folder tree below, and drag-and-drop everywhere. Drag footage onto the Timeline or
  Viewer to make a layer; with no comp open yet, the composition dialogue appears
  already filled in from that footage. Solids are proper assets now — one "White solid"
  in the project can back fifty layers, and the first one you make creates a Solids
  folder that future solids follow even if you rename it or tuck it inside another
  folder (Kiriko remembers the folder itself, not its name). Compositions do the same
  with a Compositions folder. Multi-step creations like that land as a single undo
  step — a batch operation whose inverse is just the reversed inverses of its members.
- **Epochs (`kiriko-eval::epoch`)** — the cancellation mechanism the whole scheduler
  will stand on. Every scheduled job carries a ticket stamped with the number that was
  on the wall when it started; scrubbing or stopping turns the wall number over, and
  workers glance at the wall between small steps and quietly stop if their ticket is
  stale. Nothing is ever force-killed. A test proves a deliberately slow job stops
  within 15 milliseconds of the number changing.
- **The frame scheduler's brain (`kiriko-eval::schedule`)** — the decision rules for
  smooth playback, written as plain arithmetic so tests can prove them. During playback
  Kiriko renders frames ahead of the playhead onto a small shelf; each screen refresh
  takes the newest shelf frame whose time has come, quietly binning ones the clock has
  passed, and simply holds the last picture if rendering falls behind (sound never
  waits). How far ahead to render adapts to how slow frames have actually been, between
  8 and 16 frames. And in realtime mode, frames too slow for the frame budget drop to a
  coarser preview resolution within a frame or two, earning it back only after a
  sustained cheap stretch — quick to worsen, slow to improve, so the picture never
  flickers between qualities. None of the real machinery (threads, the audio clock, the
  GPU) lives here yet; this is the referee, and the players arrive later.
- **Mask editing in the Viewer** — select a layer with masks and its outlines draw
  over the picture in clay, with a square handle on every vertex. Drag a handle and
  the outline follows your cursor live; let go and the pixels update — one undo step
  per drag, like every other edit. The maths mirrors the layer's transform both ways
  (screen position → layer space and back), so handles stay glued to the picture at
  any zoom, pan, scale or rotation. The Pen button in the Viewer bar arms
  click-to-place drawing: each click drops a vertex, clicking the first one (it grows a
  ring once closable) closes the shape into a mask, Escape cancels, right-click on any
  handle removes a vertex. Curved tangent handles are the remaining slice.
- **Origin (anchor point)** — every layer's transform now starts with Anchor x / Anchor y:
  the point the layer scales and rotates *about*, and the point Position places in the
  comp. New layers default it to the centre of their content and sit centred in the comp
  (the After Effects default), so a fresh clip spins about its middle rather than its
  top-left corner. The selected layer shows its origin as a small clay crosshair in the
  Viewer, and you can **drag that crosshair to move the origin** — the layer stays put
  while its pivot shifts (After Effects' "pan behind", position compensates automatically),
  committed as one undo step.
- **The tool strip** — the row of buttons under the menu sets what a Viewer drag does,
  the way every editor's toolbar does. Select (V) and Hand (H) both pan the view for
  now (object selection comes with the object tools); Shape (Q) rubber-bands a new mask
  — right-click the Shape button to choose rectangle, ellipse or star; Pen (G) is the
  click-to-place mask drawing above. The mode is one value (`ToolMode`) the Viewer reads
  each frame, so the whole app agrees on what the mouse is doing.
- **Masks on Precomp layers** — a masked transition can now wipe a whole nested comp,
  the flow staple. Pixel layers (footage, solids, text) get their masks applied on the
  CPU before upload; a Precomp's pixels only ever exist on the GPU, so its mask stack
  is rasterised into a little coverage texture instead and the compositor multiplies
  it in per-fragment. Same maths, two routes — a GPU test pins the texture route to
  the CPU one.
- **Blend modes** — the full everyday set: Normal, Add, Multiply, Screen, Overlay,
  Soft light, Hard light, Lighten, Darken. Two families under the hood: Add and
  Multiply are physical light maths and run in linear; Screen, Overlay and the lights
  are the Photoshop-era formulas people know by eye, so Kiriko runs them on encoded
  values (running them in linear is tidier maths and the wrong look). Lighten and
  Darken are a simple per-channel max/min where the distinction doesn't matter. Every
  mode is pinned to its textbook formula by a GPU test.
- **Colour depth, in one paragraph.** Kiriko's frames are "half float" (fp16) in linear
  light. Unlike AE's 16bpc — which is integer maths that clips at 1.0 — half float
  keeps brightness above 1.0 (a glow can genuinely overshoot) and negatives, which is
  what people switch AE to 32bpc for. Depth is one project-wide switch (8 / 16 float /
  32 float — K-069): flip it and every comp and effect in the project renders at that
  depth, AE-style, via a small button at the foot of the Project panel. Full float
  doubles every frame's memory and roughly halves compositing throughput, so 16-float
  stays the default; the heavy maths inside effects can run wider internally either way.
- `crates/kiriko-ui/src/theme.rs` — **the Aizome tokens.** The only file allowed to contain
  colour values. Change a colour here, it changes everywhere.
- `crates/kiriko-ui/src/shell.rs` + `app_state.rs` — **the window**: panels, menus,
  shortcuts, and the state glue (current project, dirty flag, autosave timer, recovery
  prompt).

## 5. Making a change safely (the recipe)

1. **Find the doc first.** Specs (`docs/00–16`) say what the behaviour should be; impl
   notes (`docs/impl/`) say how the hard parts work. If your change disagrees with a doc,
   the doc gets updated in the same commit — docs are canonical.
2. **Make the change.** The compiler is your ally: in Rust, most mistakes fail to compile
   rather than fail at runtime. Read its messages — they're unusually helpful and usually
   tell you exactly what to fix.
3. **Run `cargo test`.** Everything green? Your change didn't break any promise that's
   been made so far.
4. **Add a test for what you changed.** New behaviour = new test proving it. Fixed a bug =
   a regression test that fails without your fix (that bug can now never return unnoticed).
5. **Commit with a message saying what and why.** CI re-runs everything on every push.

Even if you never write the change yourself, this recipe is how you *direct* a model to do
it and check it did it right: point at the doc, ask for the change plus its test, look at
the test.

## 6. The testing philosophy (and your regression-coverage rule)

Standing policy, enforced in CI ([14-ENGINEERING-RULES.md](14-ENGINEERING-RULES.md) §tests):

- **Every feature lands with tests.** Not after — with. A feature without tests is not done.
- **Every bug fix lands with a regression test** that reproduces the bug first. The suite
  is a museum of every bug ever fixed, and none of them can come back silently.
- **Property tests** generate thousands of random inputs looking for edge cases humans
  don't think of (the time maths runs under these).
- **Golden tests** compare output against a known-correct reference — later, whole rendered
  frames get compared pixel-by-pixel, which is how "preview equals export" stays true.
- **Coverage is measured in CI** and the engine crates must stay above the threshold —
  it can only be raised, never lowered.

One budget deserves its own mention because it's the project's founding grievance: **the
interface must stay responsive with thousands of layers and hundreds of thousands of
keyframes** (the "stress document" budgets in
[13-PERFORMANCE-RULES.md](13-PERFORMANCE-RULES.md) §2.1). Two design rules deliver it: the
UI only ever draws what's visible on screen (so a 5,000-layer timeline costs the same as a
20-layer one), and the UI thread never does engine work. One known shortcut exists today —
saving a snapshot currently copies the whole document per edit, which is fine now and will
be replaced with "copy only what changed" before Phase 1 ends; it's recorded in the
performance rules so it can't be forgotten.

What the suite guards *today*: time maths exactness (6 property suites), undo/redo
symmetry, journal replay, the crash-recovery drill both ways, file-format round-trips,
unknown-field survival, autosave rotation, version refusal.

## 7. Words you'll meet in the code

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `fn` | A function |
| `pub` | Public — usable from other files/crates |
| `let` | Create a variable |
| `&thing` / `&mut thing` | Borrow it read-only / borrow it with permission to change |
| `impl X` | "Here are X's functions" |
